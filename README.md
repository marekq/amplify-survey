Create a custom online survey webpage using AWS Amplify. This repository contains the Amplify frontend code written in Vue and the backend which consists of a REST API Gateway, a Lambda function in Python and a DynamoDB table to store survey results. You can deploy the project using Amplify by adding this repo or a fork to Amplify.
